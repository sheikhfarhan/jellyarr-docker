# Media Server (Docker Compose + Jellyfin + Arr Stacks)

**An automated media stack running on Arch Linux (CachyOS).**

This repo documents the journey of building a self-hosted media server. It features a **"Split-Network" architecture** that balances VPN isolation for downloads with direct access for streaming, protected by security layers.

Hope it will help the future-me when and if i need to redeploy this to another machine/dedicated server. And of course, if it helps others to make sense of things and deploy something similar, it would be awesome too! :)

## 🖥️ System Specs

  * **Host:** CachyOS (Arch Linux)
  * **Hardware:** AMD 7600x, 32GB RAM, AQC113C 10GbE NIC, Radeon 5600xt
  * **Storage:** 2 x 1TB NVMEs in an LVM (`vg_pool01`) mounted at `/mnt/pool01`
  * **Network:** Custom Bridge (`dockerapps-net`) with IPv6 + Reverse Proxy (Caddy)

-----

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

### The "Two-Zone" Network Model

We separate services into two distinct network zones.

  * **Zone 1: Trusted Apps (`dockerapps-net`)**
      * *Services:* Jellyfin, Jellyseerr, Caddy, Radarr, Sonarr, Bazarr, Homepage etc..
      * *Behavior:* Uses host internet for metadata & streaming. Accessible via Reverse Proxy.

  * **Zone 2: The VPN Bubble (`service:gluetun`)**
      * *Services:* qBittorrent, Transmission, FlareSolverr.
      * *Behavior:* These containers have **NO** IP address. They use `gluetun`'s network stack to force 100% of traffic through the AirVPN WireGuard tunnel.
      * *Paid Service:* Airvpn Subscription

### The Security Stack

  * **Ingress:** **Caddy** (Ports 80/443) with Cloudflare DNS validation.
  * **Defense:**
      * **CrowdSec:** IPS reading Caddy logs to ban malicious IPs.
      * **GeoIP:** Blocks all non-Singaporean traffic at the proxy level.
      * **Socket Proxy:** Read-only gateway for docker.sock, preventing container breakout.
  * **Firewall:** Host-level `firewalld` rules preventing Docker containers from scanning the home LAN.

If I were to clone this repo to a brand-new machine right now and ran `start-stacks.sh`, **it would fail immediately.**

### **The "Invisible" Gaps (Why it would fail)**

This repo contains the *application* logic, but it is missing the **Host-Level Dependencies** that I configured manually in the terminal along the way.

1.  **The Network Error:** Docker will complain that `dockerapps-net` does not exist. The `compose` files expect it to be `external`, so they won't create it for us.
2.  **The "Connection Refused" Error:** Without the specific `/etc/docker/daemon.json` IPv6/DNS fix I applied, containers might fail to talk to each other.
3.  **The "Missing File" Error:** Caddy will crash because `GeoLite2-Country.mmdb` is excluded from the repo (correctly), but it doesn't exist on the new host.
4.  **The "Missing Secrets" Error:** The `.env` files are git-ignored. A fresh clone has no API keys, so containers will start with empty variables and crash.
5.  **The Firewall:** `firewalld` won't be installed or configured, so even if Caddy starts, no one can reach it.
6.  **Homepage-Crowdsec API Error:** `crowdsec` will generate a new Machine ID (because the database is fresh) and utilities/homepage/config/services.yaml will still contain the old username/password for the CrowdSec widget.

To make this truly reproducible, I try to document the [**"One-Time Setup"**](/docs/from-zero.md) steps below that *must* happen before the scripts can run.

*I would also need to refer to the rest of the [docs/](docs/) folder for granular details on specific services.*
